# seo-info-bookmarklet
JS-Code-Snippet that reads some basic SEO info from a page in the browser and opens a new window showing the gathered information.

![Gif showng a demo of the snippet]([se](https://github.com/seoseb-de/seo-info-bookmarklet/blob/main/seo_quick-check_seoseb.gif?raw=true))

The Code uses [W3CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) for styling the output document. 
Depending on CORS setting on the Page you are looking at the styles may not be loaded and the close() button will not work. 
Eventually I will add independend inline styles later.
