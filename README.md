# seo-info-bookmarklet
JS-Code-Snippet that reads some basic SEO info from a page in the browser and opens a new window showing the gathered information.

The Code uses [W3CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) for styling the output document. Maybe I will add independend inline styles later.
